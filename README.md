# random-fights-generator
Displaying a random 1vs1 fight between characters with different characteristics and skills.

Description of the exercise:

"There are 4 different types of fighters: the Warriors who have lots of life points, medium damage and low stamina, the Assasins with low life points, high damage and high stamina, Wizards with low life points, high damage and high mana and finally the Healers with low life points, low damage and low mana. Mana is like stamina for magic fighters (wizards and healers).

Each of them have got a skill: the Warriors have a bonus on defense, the Assasins a bonus on attack, the Wizards can heal (but not much) and the healers got high healing capacity.

Every fighter needs stamina/mana to attack and they consume some of it with each attack, without stamina or mana a fighter can't attack. The fight will conclude when one of the fighters is dead or none have any points of stamina/mana left.

Display a 1vs1 fight between 2 random characters where they attack or use their powers randomly."
